# 100 Days of Python 

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** repository! This is a curated collection of Python projects I’ve built while working through Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp." Instead of posting every daily exercise, I’m sharing only the projects I’m proud of—ranging from beginner to intermediate level—as I level up my coding skills form begineer to advanced.

## About This Repository
- **Inspiration:** [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu
- **Purpose:** To showcase my favorite Python projects and track my growth as a coder.

## Projects
Here’s a selection of the projects you’ll find in this repo:

- **`HigherLowerGame`**  
  A fun guessing game where you compare follower counts of celebrities. Built with basic logic and data structures.

- **`TurtleArt`**  
  Creative drawings and shapes made with Python’s Turtle module—my first dive into graphics!

- **`SnakeGame`**  
  A classic snake game with high-score saving, using file handling and basic game loops.

- **`PasswordManager`**  
  A simple GUI app built with Tkinter to store and retrieve passwords securely.



More projects will be added as I progress through the course and build cooler stuff!

## Repository Structure
- Each project lives in its own folder (e.g., `HigherLowerGame`, `SnakeGame`).
- Inside each folder, you’ll find the main `.py` file and any supporting files (e.g., text files or images).

## How to Run the Projects
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/S-V-Kartheek/100DaysOfPython.git`
2. Navigate to a project folder: `cd 100DaysOfPython/ProjectName`
3. Run the script: `python3 filename.py`
4. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** Tkinter (GUIs), Turtle (graphics),pandas and more as I explore further.
- **IDE:** VS Code, PyCharm or Replit

## Why This Approach?
I’m skipping the super basic projects (like calculators or rock-paper-scissors) to focus on sharing work that feels meaningful or challenging. This repo is less about daily logs and more about highlighting my coding journey’s best moments.
